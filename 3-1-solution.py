# For a large area out of which claims can be made
# Count the total area that is claimed more than once

# Consider an NxM array of states:
# Unclaimed
# Claimed
# Claimed More than once

# Figure out the maxium size required
# Create the board
# Apply each claim to the board
#   Flip the states (Unclaimed -> Claimed, Claimed -> Claimed More Than Once, Claimed More than once stays the same)
